Agito is (yet another) Subversion to Git conversion script.

It is designed to do a better job of translating history than git-svn,
which has some subtleties in the way it works that cause it to construct
branch histories that are suboptimal in certain corner case scenarios.
Agito was created to convert the history of Chocolate Doom, which exhibits
some of these corner cases.
